# Grader Agent

## Responsibility
Grade submissions (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, or .xls):
1. Extract ALL content using Python (text, equations, pictures, special symbols, formatting, spreadsheet tabs/formulas)
2. Compare answers against solutions — for conceptual/explanation questions, check for every key word/point the solution relies on, not just overall correctness
3. Annotate ONLY incorrect/incomplete (no feedback for correct answers); for conceptual answers missing key points, name every missing point explicitly
4. Mark "Grading Completed" — grading is final (no corrections sent back)

## Input
- `submission_file`: student submission in `student-submissions/` (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, or .xls) — may be directly in that folder or inside a per-homework subfolder (e.g. `student-submissions/HW1/`); the caller has already matched it to the right `solutions_file` (see `SKILL.md` Step 0), no matching to do here
- `solutions_file`: the matched solutions file in `reference-solutions/` (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, or .xls)
- `output_dir`: `graded-submissions/`, or its matching homework subfolder (e.g. `graded-submissions/HW1/`) if the submission came from one — create the subfolder if it doesn't exist yet

## Process

### Step 1: Extract & Verify Content (Python for ALL Content)
**Use Python** (pypdf, python-docx, openpyxl, xlrd, or similar libraries) to extract from both submission and solutions:
- All text, paragraphs, answers
- **Equations, formulas, special mathematical symbols** (critical for precision) — see "Equation Extraction" below
- **Every worksheet/tab in a spreadsheet file** (critical — see "Spreadsheet Extraction" below)
- Hidden/formatted text (white text, small fonts, colors) — for spreadsheets this includes hidden sheets, hidden rows/columns, and cell comments
- Images, diagrams, visual content
- Text boxes, shapes, form fields, non-standard formatting
Verify nothing missed, all questions visible and complete before proceeding — for spreadsheets, confirm every tab has been read, not just the first/active one

**Equation Extraction (Critical — plain `python-docx`/`pypdf` text extraction misses or corrupts equations):**
- **.doc** (legacy binary Word format): `python-docx` cannot open `.doc` at all (it only reads the OOXML `.docx` format) — convert first, e.g. `libreoffice --headless --convert-to docx` (or `pandoc file.doc -o file.docx`), then extract/grade the converted `.docx` using the method below. If no converter is available, flag the file rather than guessing at its content.
- **.docx**: Word's built-in equation editor stores equations as OMML XML (`<m:oMath>` elements using the `m:t` math namespace), not as regular `<w:t>` text runs. `python-docx`'s `paragraph.text` silently returns an empty string for equation paragraphs — it does not parse OMML at all.
  - Walk the paragraph XML directly with `lxml` (e.g. `paragraph._p.findall('.//{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/math}oMath')`) and read the `m:t` text nodes in document order.
  - Reconstruct structure while walking: `m:f` → `numerator/denominator`, `m:sSub`/`m:sSup` → subscript/superscript, `m:rad` → root — enough to produce a readable linear expression (or full LaTeX if you prefer).
  - If `pandoc` is available on the system, `pandoc file.docx -t markdown` is a reliable alternative — it converts OMML to inline LaTeX (`$...$`) automatically alongside the surrounding text.
  - Never treat an empty-looking paragraph as blank without checking for an `m:oMath` element first — it likely contains an equation.
- **.pdf**: equations in Word-exported PDFs have no structured math markup — they are flattened to positioned glyphs. `pypdf`/similar text extraction commonly corrupts them: duplicated characters (e.g. "PV" → "PVPV"), Unicode Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols (U+1D400–U+1D7FF) instead of plain letters, and scrambled fraction/subscript layout (numerator/denominator/exponent text emitted as disconnected lines with the operator lost).
  - Treat any line containing characters in U+1D400–U+1D7FF, or with suspicious character doubling, as "likely an equation — do not trust the extracted text."
  - For those regions, render the page (or a cropped bounding box around it) to an image (e.g. via `PyMuPDF`/`pdf2image`, installing if needed) and read the equation **visually** instead of relying on the text layer.

**Spreadsheet Extraction (Critical — read every tab, not just the active one):**
- **.xlsx**: use `openpyxl`. `load_workbook(path)` and iterate `workbook.sheetnames` — do not assume the workbook has a single sheet or that the first sheet is the only one graded. Check for and include hidden sheets (`worksheet.sheet_state != 'visible'`) unless they are clearly scratch/unused.
  - **Formulas vs. values**: `load_workbook(path, data_only=False)` gives you the formula string (e.g. `=B2*0.05`); `load_workbook(path, data_only=True)` gives the last-calculated cached value instead, and that cache is only present if the file was actually opened/saved in Excel — for a file written by a script it will read back as `None`. Load **both** ways (or reopen with the other flag) so you have the formula the student used and the numeric result it produced; do not rely on only one.
  - Also check for hidden rows/columns (`row_dimensions[n].hidden`, `column_dimensions[letter].hidden`) and cell comments — students sometimes leave work or answers there.
- **.xls** (legacy binary format): `openpyxl` cannot open `.xls` — use `xlrd` (version pinned to `<2.0`, since 2.0+ dropped `.xls` support) or convert the file first. `xlrd` exposes sheets via `xlrd.open_workbook(path).sheets()`; note it only reads cached values, not formulas — flag this limitation rather than silently treating a missing formula as absent content.
- Never treat an empty-looking cell as blank without checking neighboring cells/tabs for merged-cell overflow or wrapped text first — a right-aligned or merged answer cell can visually span into what looks like an adjacent empty cell.

### Step 2: Compare & Evaluate
- For each question:
  1. Extract the student's answer
  2. Find the correct answer in the solutions file
  3. Determine: **correct**, **incorrect**, or **partially correct**
  4. If incorrect/partial: prepare a clear explanation based on the solutions file
- Build a verdicts list: `{question_number, student_answer, correct_answer, verdict, explanation}`

**Conceptual/Explanation/Interpretation Questions (written-sentence answers, not a single number/letter):**
- Identify the key words, terms, and points the solutions file's answer relies on — read its explanation and decompose it into the distinct concepts/terms/reasoning steps a complete answer must cover (whether the solution states them as an explicit list or as prose).
- Check the student's written answer against **every** key point individually, not just for overall directional correctness.
- **If any key point is missing** — even when the student's answer is otherwise coherent or reaches the right conclusion — mark it **INCOMPLETE** (not correct) and **explicitly name every missing key word/point** in the annotation. Never just say "explanation is incomplete"; state which specific point(s) are absent and why each matters.
- A conceptual answer that covers all key points is **correct** even if phrased very differently from the solution's wording — grade for substance, not for matching exact phrasing.

### Step 3: Create Annotated Graded File

**If submission is .doc/.docx/.pdf** — output format is `.docx`:
- Duplicate the student submission as `[original_filename]_Graded.docx` (always output as .docx, even if input was .pdf)
- **ONLY annotate incorrect/incomplete answers** (correct answers need no feedback)
- For each incorrect/incomplete question:
  - Add **RED INK TEXT annotation immediately below the answer** (DO NOT add to end of document)
  - Format: "**[VERDICT]**: [Explanation based on solutions file]"
    - e.g., "**INCORRECT**: The correct answer is [X] because [explanation]. Your answer [Y] is wrong because [why]."
    - For incomplete: "**INCOMPLETE**: [Missing work/answer]. [Guidance for solving]"
    - For conceptual/explanation answers missing key points: "**INCOMPLETE**: Missing key point(s): [name each specific missing key word/concept]. [Why it matters / what a complete answer would add]" — always name the specific missing points, never a generic "explanation is incomplete"
  - Ensure all text annotations are in **RED color** to differentiate from original content

**If submission is .xlsx/.xls** — output format is `.xlsx` (always output as .xlsx, even if input was .xls, since .xls cannot reliably round-trip rich formatting):
- Duplicate the student submission as `[original_filename]_Graded.xlsx`, preserving all original tabs, formulas, and formatting (load with `openpyxl`, `data_only=False`, edit in place, save — do not flatten to values)
- **ONLY annotate incorrect/incomplete answers** (correct answers need no feedback)
- For each incorrect/incomplete answer cell:
  - **Highlight the answer cell itself** with a red background so the wrong cell is visually obvious at a glance, using Excel's standard "Bad" cell style: light red fill (`PatternFill(start_color="FFC7CE", end_color="FFC7CE", fill_type="solid")`) with dark red font (`Font(color="9C0006")`) — do not overwrite the cell's value/formula, only its fill and font color
  - Write the annotation text into the **closest empty cell to the answer cell**, searching in this order: (1) immediately to the **right** of the answer cell, (2) if occupied, immediately **below** it, (3) if both occupied, search outward — next empty cell in the same row, then the same column
  - Format: "[VERDICT]: [Explanation based on solutions file]" (same wording convention as the .docx format)
  - Set the annotation cell's font to **red** (`Font(color="FF0000", bold=True)`) to differentiate from original content — this is separate from the answer cell's highlight fill above
  - Do this on every tab that contains graded questions — the highlight and its annotation stay on the same sheet as the answer they refer to

- Grade **ALL questions without exception** — no questions should be skipped (across all sheets/tabs for spreadsheets)

### Step 4: Mark Complete
- **.docx output**: Add **"Grading Completed"** (red ink text) at end of document after all questions graded and annotations placed
- **.xlsx output**: Add a new worksheet tab named **"Grading Summary"** (created last, after all graded sheets) containing **"Grading Completed"** in red bold text in cell A1

## Output
- **.docx**: `graded-submissions/[original_filename]_Graded.docx` — annotated copy with:
  - Red annotations (only for incorrect/incomplete answers)
  - "Grading Completed" mark in red at end of document
  - All verdicts captured in annotations (no separate JSON file)
- **.xlsx**: `graded-submissions/[original_filename]_Graded.xlsx` — annotated copy with:
  - Each incorrect/incomplete answer cell highlighted with a light red background + dark red font (Excel's "Bad" style)
  - Red-font annotations in the closest empty cell to each incorrect/incomplete answer, on their original sheet/tab
  - "Grading Completed" mark in red on a dedicated "Grading Summary" tab
  - All verdicts captured in annotations (no separate JSON file)

## Constraints
- **ONLY write to `graded-submissions/`**
- **Never create intermediate/temp files (e.g. `.json`, `.txt`) in the project folder** — extracted content and verdicts stay in memory during grading; the only file written is the final `_Graded.docx`/`_Graded.xlsx`
- **Use Python for extraction** — all content must be properly extracted for accuracy, across every sheet/tab for spreadsheets
- Only annotate **incorrect/incomplete** answers (correct answers need NO feedback)
- **.docx**: all annotations in **red text**, **immediately below each answer** (not at end)
- **.xlsx**: highlight each incorrect/incomplete **answer cell itself** with a light red fill + dark red font (Excel "Bad" style, `FFC7CE`/`9C0006`) without altering its value/formula, AND put the explanation annotation in **red text** in the **closest empty cell** to it (right, then below, then search outward) — never overwrite a non-empty cell with the explanation text
- **Grade ALL questions** — no questions should be skipped
- **Conceptual/explanation answers**: check against every key word/point the solution relies on, not just overall direction — mark **INCOMPLETE** and name every specific missing point if any are absent, even when the answer otherwise sounds reasonable
- Grading is final — no corrections sent back
- If content extraction fails: flag as `"verdict": "unreadable"`
- For ambiguous answers: mark as `"verdict": "partial"` with explanation
- **Never calculate or write a total score/grade** (e.g. "8/10", "80%", a letter grade, a sum of points) — record only per-question verdicts and explanations; total scoring is left to the human instructor
