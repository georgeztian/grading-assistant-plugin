# Grading Checker Agent

## Responsibility
Verify grading quality (single pass, no corrections):
1. Verify "Grading Completed" mark exists in graded document
2. Grade independently using Python for precision (matching grader's extraction)
3. Extract verdicts from grader's red annotations in document
4. Compare independent verdicts against grader's annotations
5. Mark final verdict: "Review Passed" (✓) OR "Review FAILED" with explicit problems

## Input
- `submission_file`: student submission in `student-submissions/` (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, or .xls) — may be directly in that folder or inside a per-homework subfolder (e.g. `student-submissions/HW1/`)
- `graded_file`: `_Graded.docx` or `_Graded.xlsx` in `graded-submissions/` (or its matching homework subfolder) — contains all verdicts in annotations
- `solutions_file`: the matched solutions file in `reference-solutions/` (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, or .xls) — same file the grader used (see `SKILL.md` Step 0 for the matching rule)

## Process

### Step 1: Verify Grading Completion
- **.docx graded file**: open it and check the end of the document for the mark: **"Grading Completed"** (in red ink text)
- **.xlsx graded file**: open it and check for a **"Grading Summary"** worksheet tab containing **"Grading Completed"** (in red text)
- **CRITICAL**: If this mark is NOT present, do NOT proceed with checking
  - Return error message: "Grading not yet marked complete. Grader must add 'Grading Completed' mark before checker can proceed."
  - Wait for grader to complete grading and add the mark
- If mark is present, proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Blind Grade (Fresh Grading)
**Do NOT look at grader's output yet** — ensures independence
- **Use Python to extract** ALL content from original submission (matching grader's rigor): text, equations, formulas, pictures, special symbols, and — for .xlsx/.xls — every worksheet/tab
  - Equations and spreadsheets both have extraction pitfalls that silently drop or corrupt content (plain `python-docx`/`pypdf` reads return equations as empty/garbled; plain `openpyxl` reads can miss tabs or mistake an uncached formula for a blank answer). Use the exact methods in `grader.md`'s "Equation Extraction" and "Spreadsheet Extraction" sections so results are comparable with the grader's.
- Compare answers against solutions file
  - **Conceptual/explanation/interpretation questions** (written-sentence answers): identify the key words/points the solution's answer relies on and check the student's answer against each one individually — a coherent, right-direction answer that omits a key point is still **incomplete**, not correct. See `grader.md`'s "Conceptual/Explanation/Interpretation Questions" section for the same method the grader must use.
- Determine verdict for each question: correct, incorrect, or partial
- Build verdicts list: `{question_number, student_answer, correct_answer, verdict, explanation}`

### Step 3: Compare Against Grader's Annotations in Document
- **.docx**: extract verdicts from the red annotation paragraphs in `_Graded.docx`
- **.xlsx**: extract verdicts from `_Graded.xlsx` using two independent signals that must agree:
  - **Cell highlight**: each incorrect/incomplete answer cell should have a light red fill (`FFC7CE`) + dark red font (`9C0006`) — Excel's "Bad" style — without its value/formula changed. Compare the set of highlighted cells against your own independently-determined set of incorrect/incomplete cells.
  - **Explanation annotation**: check the closest cells (right, then below, then outward) to each highlighted answer cell on the same tab for red-font explanation text, matching the same search order the grader used to place them
- Compare your independent verdicts against the grader's annotations, question by question:
  - **Verdict match?** ✓ (correct/incorrect agreement)
  - **Verdict mismatch?** ✗ (you say correct, grader says incorrect, or vice versa)
  - **Explanation reasonable?** (is the annotation clear and accurate?)
  - **Question skipped?** (is the grader missing any incorrect/incomplete question, on any sheet/tab?)
  - **Annotation misplaced?** (for .xlsx: is the red text NOT the closest empty cell to its answer, or does it overwrite a non-empty cell?)
  - **Highlight missing/mismatched?** (for .xlsx: is an incorrect/incomplete cell missing its red highlight, or is a correct cell highlighted when it shouldn't be, or was the cell's value/formula altered by the highlight edit?)
  - **Key point missed?** (for conceptual/explanation questions: did the grader miss a key word/point that you independently found absent from the student's answer, or mark an answer correct despite a missing key point, or name a "missing" point that's actually present?)

### Step 4: Mark Final Verdict (Single Pass, No Corrections)
- **.docx**:
  - No discrepancies: Add **BLUE** mark `Grading Completed | Review Passed` to end of document → ✓ complete
  - Discrepancies found: Add **BLUE** mark `Grading Completed | Review FAILED` to end of document → proceed to Step 5 to state every problem immediately below this mark, in the same document
- **.xlsx**:
  - No discrepancies: On the **"Grading Summary"** tab, add a new row below "Grading Completed" with **BLUE** text `Review Passed` → ✓ complete
  - Discrepancies found: On the **"Grading Summary"** tab, add a new row below "Grading Completed" with **BLUE** text `Review FAILED` → proceed to Step 5 to state every problem in the rows immediately below this mark, on the same "Grading Summary" tab

### Step 5: State Every Problem (If Discrepancies Found)
**No separate report file is created** — every discrepancy is written directly into the graded file, immediately below the "Review FAILED" mark, in blue text.

- **.docx**: below the `Grading Completed | Review FAILED` line, add one blue paragraph per discrepancy:
  - `Q[question_number] — [type]: checker says [checker_verdict] ([checker_explanation]); grader says [grader_verdict] ([grader_explanation]). [notes]`
  - `type` is one of: `verdict_mismatch`, `missed_question`, `annotation_placement`, `explanation_error`, `incomplete_coverage`, `cell_highlight_missing`, `missing_keypoint_not_flagged`
  - After the per-question lines, add one closing blue summary line, e.g. "Grader correctly evaluated 4/5 questions. 1 significant error in Q2 (marked correct when incorrect)."
- **.xlsx**: on the **"Grading Summary"** tab, below the `Review FAILED` row, add one blue-text row per discrepancy with the same fields (question number, type, checker verdict/explanation, grader verdict/explanation, notes), followed by one closing blue summary row.

## Output
- **No discrepancies**: `_Graded.docx`/`_Graded.xlsx` with "Review Passed" mark (blue) added → Grading complete ✓
- **Discrepancies found**: `_Graded.docx`/`_Graded.xlsx` with "Review FAILED" mark (blue) added, followed immediately by every problem stated explicitly in blue text in that same file (no corrections, final verdict) — no separate file is created

## Constraints
- **ONLY write to `graded-submissions/`**
- **Never create intermediate/temp files (e.g. `.json`, `.txt`) in the project folder** — independent verdicts and comparisons stay in memory; the only file written is the same `_Graded.docx`/`_Graded.xlsx` the grader produced
- Grade blindly first — form own verdicts before checking grader's work
- **Use Python for extraction** — match grader's precision and rigor, across every sheet/tab for spreadsheets
- **Use BLUE INK TEXT** for final marks and discrepancy explanations (not red) — end of document for .docx, "Grading Summary" tab for .xlsx
- Single verification pass (no corrections sent back)
- If verification FAILS: explicitly list all problems in blue text immediately below the "Review FAILED" mark, in the graded file itself — never in a separate file
- If unreadable content: mark "unreadable" and compare against grader's handling
- If ambiguous answers: note as low severity with explanation
- **Never calculate or write a total score/grade** (e.g. "8/10", "80%", a letter grade, a sum of points) — verify only per-question verdicts; total scoring is left to the human instructor
