# Concurrent Grading Workflow

Orchestrates parallel **grader agent** (red annotations for incorrect/incomplete only) + **independent checker agent** (single-pass verification, no corrections).

**Key Requirements**: 
- **Only edit files in `graded-submissions/`**
- **No unnecessary intermediate files**: neither agent creates intermediate/temp files (e.g. `.json`, `.txt`) anywhere in the project folder — all extraction and comparison work stays in memory; the only files written are the final `_Graded.docx`/`_Graded.xlsx`
- Python-based content extraction for ALL content (text, equations, pictures, special symbols, formatting, spreadsheet tabs/formulas)
- Supports .doc, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, and .xls, for both submissions and solutions
- Single verification pass (no correction loops)
- **No scoring**: neither agent calculates or writes a total score/grade (e.g. "8/10", "80%", a letter grade) — only per-question verdicts and explanations; scoring is left to the human instructor

**Extraction caveats**: plain `python-docx`/`pypdf`/`openpyxl` reads can silently miss or corrupt content — Word equations (OMML) read back empty from `.docx` and as corrupted Unicode from PDF; spreadsheets need every tab read (not just the active one) with both formula and cached-value passes. Full method and required libraries are in `grader.md`'s "Equation Extraction" and "Spreadsheet Extraction" sections — grader and checker must use the same method for comparable results.

**Annotation convention**: documents get red feedback text immediately below the wrong answer; spreadsheets get two markers instead — the wrong cell itself highlighted in Excel's "Bad" style (light red fill/dark red font) plus a red explanation in the closest empty cell to it. Full placement rules are in `grader.md` Step 3/4.

**Conceptual/explanation questions**: for written-sentence answers, grading isn't just right/wrong — the grader must check the student's answer against every key word/point the solution relies on and name any that are missing, even if the answer otherwise sounds reasonable. Full method is in `grader.md`'s "Conceptual/Explanation/Interpretation Questions" section; grader and checker must use the same method.

## Step 0: Discover Submissions & Match Solutions (before invoking any agent)

`student-submissions/` and `reference-solutions/` may each be flat, or organized into per-homework subfolders (e.g. `HW1/`, `HW2/`) — not always, and not always the same way on both sides. Before invoking the grader for any submission, resolve which solutions file grades it:

- **Flat submission** (sits directly in `student-submissions/`): pair it with the solutions file that sits directly in `reference-solutions/`.
  - **If more than one flat solutions file exists**, filename alone won't tell you which one applies (they aren't required to match) — open each candidate and match by subject matter (title/case name, file type, worksheet tab names, etc.). Only proceed once one candidate is clearly the same assignment; if two or more still look equally plausible, stop and ask the user to confirm.
- **Subfoldered submission** (sits in `student-submissions/<X>/`): pair it with the solutions file(s) in `reference-solutions/<X>/` — **the subfolder name must match exactly**. A submission in `HW1/` does not match a solutions folder named `Homework 1/` or `hw1_solutions/`.
- **Mixed layouts** (some submissions flat, others in subfolders, at the same time) are expected — resolve each submission independently by the same rule.
- **No confident match found** (no exact-name subfolder, or no flat solutions file clearly matches by content): do NOT guess which solutions file applies — stop and ask the user to confirm or provide the correct solutions file before grading anything in it.
- **Output mirrors the input structure**: a submission at `student-submissions/HW1/name.docx` outputs to `graded-submissions/HW1/name_Graded.docx` (create the subfolder if it doesn't exist yet); a flat submission continues to output directly into `graded-submissions/`.

## Concurrent Workflow Overview

Both agents work independently on different files:
- **Grader**: processes submission queue, one at a time
- **Checker**: processes submissions with "Grading Completed" mark, one at a time
- Agents can be invoked concurrently (in separate processes/sessions)

## Grader: Grade Submission

**Invoke** for each submission, passing `submission_file`, the matched `solutions_file` (per Step 0), and `output_dir` — `graded-submissions/`, or its matching homework subfolder if the submission was subfoldered. Full process, extraction requirements, and output format are defined in `grader.md` — grading is final, no correction mode.

## Checker: Single-Pass Verification

**Invoke** once a submission has its "Grading Completed" mark, passing `submission_file`, `graded_file` (the `_Graded.docx`/`_Graded.xlsx` in `graded-submissions/`), and `solutions_file`. Full process is defined in `grading-checker.md` — grades independently first, then compares against the grader's annotations.

**Final verdict** (single pass — never sent back to the grader for correction):
- **"Review Passed"** (blue mark): grading complete and verified ✓
- **"Review FAILED"** (blue mark), immediately followed by every problem stated explicitly in blue text in the same graded file (no separate report file): user reviews manually and decides next steps

### Discrepancy Types & Severity

| Type | Meaning | Severity |
|------|---------|----------|
| `verdict_mismatch` | Grader/checker disagree on correct/incorrect | high |
| `missed_question` | Grader skipped a question | high |
| `annotation_placement` | Feedback not immediately below answer | medium |
| `explanation_error` | Explanation unclear/incomplete/wrong | medium |
| `incomplete_coverage` | Multi-part question not fully addressed | medium |
| `cell_highlight_missing` | (.xlsx) Incorrect/incomplete cell not highlighted red, or a correct cell wrongly highlighted | medium |
| `missing_keypoint_not_flagged` | Grader missed a key word/point absent from a conceptual answer, or flagged one that's actually present | medium |
